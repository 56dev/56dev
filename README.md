# ⭐ Hello!

thank you for stopping by. I am a student and a self-taught developer based in Canada. I am currently trying to teach myself C++. I also know how to use HTML/CSS/JS and C#. 

🌿I am currently concentrating on **learning the Win32 API, reimplementing the shell, reading [SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html), and managing [my personal website](https://hci56.neocities.org).**

I also enjoy learning math in my free time.

Want to talk, work with me, or generally have a concern you need me to see? [Email me](mailto:programsym987@gmail.com) or DM me on [Twitter](https://x.com/56dev_)!
